### Documentation Standards

Each agent must:
- Create a README.md in their folder with an overview of their work
- Document all major decisions with rationale
- Include code examples where applicable
- Reference dependencies on other agents' work
- Update documentation as work progresses
- Use consistent markdown formatting

### 📁 New Documentation Structure (2025-01-12)

**Important**: We now use a versioned documentation system. Each agent's folder follows this structure:

```
docs/agents/[agent-number]-[agent-name]/
├── current/          # 📌 ALWAYS USE THIS FOR CURRENT STATE
│   ├── README.md     # Agent overview and status
│   └── [active docs] # Current documentation
├── versions/         # 📚 Historical versions
│   ├── v1.0/        # Original version
│   └── v2.0/        # Updated version
├── working/          # 🚧 Draft changes
├── STATE.json        # Version and status tracking
├── CHANGELOG.md      # Change history
└── QUICK-REFERENCE.md # One-page summary
```

**Key Files for Context**:
- `/CLAUDE.md` - Primary context file for Claude Code (start here!)
- `/docs/MANIFEST.md` - Index of all documentation
- `/docs/GUIDELINES.md` - How to update documentation

**When Working on Mile Quest**:
1. Always check `CLAUDE.md` first for current project state
2. Look in agent's `current/` folder for active documentation
3. Check `STATE.json` for version information
4. Follow `GUIDELINES.md` for making updates

### Cross-Agent Communication

- Each agent reads relevant documentation from dependency agents before starting
- Updates are committed with clear messages indicating which agent made changes
- Questions for other agents are documented in a `questions.md` file
- Decisions that affect multiple agents are documented in `/docs/decisions/`
- Weekly sync points for cross-agent coordination
- Shared terminology defined in `/docs/glossary.md`

## Success Metrics

- Code coverage > 80%
- Lighthouse mobile score > 90
- API response time < 200ms
- 99.9% uptime target
- User onboarding < 2 minutes
- Map load time < 3 seconds

## Task Tracking Legend

- ✅ **Complete** - Agent has finished all tasks
- 🚧 **In Progress** - Agent is actively working
- 🔄 **Pending** - Agent has not started
- ⚠️ **Blocked** - Agent is waiting on dependencies

## Updating Agent Status

When running an agent session:
1. Update the agent's status in this file
2. Check off completed tasks with [x]
3. Update the progress percentage in the status table
4. Add the completion date when all tasks are done
5. Ensure all outputs are documented in the agent's folder
