## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Backend Tests

- **Environment variables**: Check test environment configuration

#### Frontend Tests
- **Component mounting**: Ensure all providers are properly wrapped
- **Async operations**: Use proper waitFor patterns
- **Mock services**: Verify service mocks are reset between tests

### Debug Techniques
- Use `console.log` in test files for debugging
- Leverage VS Code Jest extension for debugging
- Check coverage reports for untested code paths
- Use React Developer Tools for component testing

## Best Practices

### Test Writing
1. **Arrange-Act-Assert** pattern
2. **Descriptive test names** explaining what is being tested
3. **Single responsibility** per test
4. **Proper cleanup** after each test
5. **Realistic test data** reflecting actual usage

### Mock Management
1. **Reset mocks** between tests
2. **Use type-safe mocks** with TypeScript
3. **Mock at appropriate levels** (service vs implementation)
4. **Verify mock interactions** when relevant

### Performance Considerations
1. **Avoid unnecessary database calls** in unit tests
2. **Use shallow rendering** when deep rendering isn't needed
3. **Batch test setup** for efficiency
4. **Monitor test execution time**

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
1. **Visual regression testing** for UI components
2. **Load testing** for API endpoints
3. **Automated accessibility scanning**
4. **Cross-browser testing** automation
5. **Mobile device testing** on real devices

### Test Coverage Expansion
1. **PWA functionality** testing
2. **Offline mode** validation
3. **Push notification** testing
4. **Background sync** verification
5. **App installation** flow testing
