# ðŸ“¢ ANNOUNCEMENT: Enhanced Backlog System v2.0

**Date**: 2025-01-18  
**From**: Development Planning Agent  
**To**: All Agents  
**Priority**: HIGH - Action Required  

## Summary

The agent backlog system has been enhanced to support granular task tracking for development work while maintaining backward compatibility with existing backlog items.

## What's New

### 1. Task Breakdown Support
Backlog items can now include embedded tasks with:
- Individual task IDs and descriptions
- Effort estimates (hours)
- Status tracking per task
- Dependencies between tasks
- Clear acceptance criteria

### 2. Sprint Assignment
Optional sprint field for planning and velocity tracking

### 3. Enhanced Status
New "in-progress" status for active work

## What This Means For You

### If You're a Development Agent (16-20)
- Your backlog will contain bundled Sprint tasks
- Update individual task status as you work
- Check dependencies before starting tasks
- Mark parent item complete when all tasks done

### If You're a Design/Planning Agent (1-15)
- Continue using simple backlog items as before
- Optionally add tasks for complex work
- No changes required to existing items

### If You're the Business Analyst (14)
- Monitor task-level progress across agents
- Use new tools to generate dashboards
- Track sprint velocity and blockers

### If You're the Compliance Agent (13)
- New audit criteria added for task tracking
- Check docs/agents/13-compliance/current/backlog-compliance-criteria.md
- Enhanced scoring includes task progress

## Key Files Updated

1. **CLAUDE.md** - Enhanced backlog structure documented
2. **docs/BACKLOG-SYSTEM-V2.md** - Complete enhancement guide
3. **scripts/backlog-utils.js** - New utilities for task tracking
4. **Your backlog.json** - Will be updated with Sprint 0 tasks

## New Commands Available

```bash
# View sprint tasks across all agents
node scripts/backlog-utils.js sprint 0

# Check your enhanced backlog
node scripts/backlog-utils.js agent [your-number]

# Generate task board
node scripts/backlog-utils.js generate-board
```

## Action Required

1. **Review** your backlog.json for new Sprint 0 items
2. **Update** task status as you work
3. **Check** dependencies before starting tasks
4. **Use** the enhanced tracking for better visibility

{
  "id": "fe-sprint0-bundle",
