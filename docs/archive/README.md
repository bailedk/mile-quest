# Archived Tracking Documents

These tracking documents were part of the original complex tracking system and have been archived as of 2025-01-18. They are kept for historical reference but should NOT be updated.

## Archived Documents

### From Business Analyst Agent
- `feature-tracking.md` - Replaced by SPRINT-TRACKING.md
- `master-task-dashboard.md` - Replaced by SPRINT-TRACKING.md

### Other Deprecated Tracking
- Complex backlog v2.0 features (tasks within backlogs)
- Sprint assignments in backlogs
- Task breakdowns in agent backlogs

## Current Tracking System

Please refer to:
1. `/docs/SPRINT-TRACKING.md` - For all development tasks
2. `/docs/TRACKING-GUIDE.md` - For how to use the new system
3. `/AGENTS.md` - For agent status overview

## Why These Were Archived

The original system had:
- Too many overlapping tracking documents
- Stale data problems
- Confusion about which document to update
- Complex nested structures that were hard to maintain

The new system uses a single source of truth (SPRINT-TRACKING.md) for all development work.
