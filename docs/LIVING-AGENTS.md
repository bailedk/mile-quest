# Living Agents Model - Mile Quest

**Created**: 2025-01-15  
**Author**: Business Analyst Agent

## Overview

Mile Quest has transitioned from a traditional "waterfall" agent model to a **Living Agents Model** where agents remain continuously active throughout the project lifecycle. This document explains the new model and how it works.

## Key Concepts

### Living Agents
- Agents are never "complete" - they deliver milestones and remain active
- Each agent maintains a `backlog.json` file with pending tasks
- Agents can be reactivated at any time with new work
- Historical context preserved through `CHANGELOG.md`

### Continuous Coordination
- Business Analyst Agent monitors all agent backlogs daily
- Cross-agent dependencies tracked in real-time
- Tasks flow between agents based on dependencies and priorities
- No agent sits idle - always ready for new work

## Backlog System

### Structure
Each agent maintains a `backlog.json` file:
```json
{
  "backlog": [
    {
      "id": "unique-id",
      "fromAgent": "requesting-agent",
      "toAgent": "this-agent", 
      "requestDate": "2025-01-15",
      "priority": "high|medium|low",
      "status": "pending|approved|rejected|completed",
      "request": "specific task description",
      "reason": "why this is needed",
      "value": "what value it provides",
      "approvedBy": "user|null",
      "approvalDate": "date|null",
      "completedDate": "date|null"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Workflow
1. Agent identifies work needed from another agent
2. Documents in `recommendations.md`
3. Requests user approval to add to target's backlog
4. BA monitors and prioritizes across all backlogs
5. Agents work on approved high-priority items first

## Agent Status Model

### Status Indicators
- üìç **Active** - Currently working on tasks
- üîÑ **Ready** - No dependencies, ready to start
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **Waiting** - Blocked by dependencies
- üö® **Critical** - Urgent issues requiring attention

### Activity Tracking
- **Active Tasks**: Number of items in backlog
- **Current Focus**: What the agent is working on
- **Last Activity**: When agent last delivered work
- **Version**: Current version of deliverables

## Benefits of Living Agents

### 1. Continuous Improvement
- Agents can refine and improve their work based on feedback
- No artificial "completion" prevents future enhancements
- Documentation evolves with the project

### 2. Better Coordination
- Real-time visibility into all agent workloads
- Dependencies tracked and managed proactively
- No agent left waiting indefinitely

### 3. Flexible Prioritization
- Work can be reprioritized based on project needs
- New requirements easily added to backlogs
- Critical issues addressed immediately

### 4. Historical Context
- CHANGELOG.md preserves all deliveries
- Version tracking shows evolution
- Decisions and rationale documented

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Agents

1. **Daily Routine**
   - Check your backlog.json
   - Work on highest priority approved items
   - Update status when completing tasks
   - Add new recommendations as discovered

2. **When Delivering Work**
   - Update CHANGELOG.md with delivery details
   - Move docs from working/ to current/
   - Update STATE.json version
   - Mark backlog items complete
   - Add any new tasks identified

3. **Cross-Agent Collaboration**
   - Document recommendations clearly
   - Include value and reason for requests
   - Respect priority levels
   - Communicate blockers immediately

### For Business Analyst

1. **Daily Monitoring**
   - Review all agent backlogs
   - Update master task dashboard
   - Identify cross-dependencies
   - Flag critical issues

2. **Weekly Planning**
   - Prioritize tasks across agents
   - Balance workloads
   - Ensure critical path progress
   - Report on velocity

3. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Identify process bottlenecks
   - Suggest workflow improvements
   - Monitor agent health
   - Facilitate communication

## Migration from Old Model

### What Changed
- ‚ùå "Complete" status ‚Üí üìç "Active" status
- ‚ùå One-time delivery ‚Üí ‚úÖ Continuous delivery
- ‚ùå Progress percentage ‚Üí ‚úÖ Active task count
- ‚ùå Finished agents ‚Üí ‚úÖ Living agents with backlogs

### What Stayed Same
- Version tracking (STATE.json)
- Documentation structure
- CHANGELOG.md for history
- Quality standards

## Success Metrics

### Agent Health
- Backlog size (ideal: 3-5 items)
- Task completion rate
- Average task age
- Cross-agent dependencies resolved

### Project Health
- Critical path progress
- Blocker resolution time
- Agent utilization rate
- Documentation currency

## FAQ

**Q: Can agents still be "done" with major work?**  
A: Agents deliver milestones and may have quiet periods, but remain available for future work.

**Q: How do we track progress without completion percentages?**  
A: Through milestone delivery, backlog completion, and feature tracking dashboards.

**Q: What if an agent has no work?**  
A: Status shows as "Ready" or "Waiting" with 0 active tasks, but agent remains available.

**Q: How do we know what an agent accomplished?**  
A: Check their CHANGELOG.md for complete delivery history and versions.

## Conclusion

The Living Agents Model transforms Mile Quest development from sequential phases to continuous, collaborative evolution. Agents work in parallel, adapt to changing needs, and maintain momentum throughout the project lifecycle.
