## Developer Agent Workflow

### 1. Task Reception
- Receive task assignments from Development Planning Agent
- Review specifications and acceptance criteria
- Identify any blockers or questions
- Estimate completion time

### 2. Implementation
- Set up development environment
- Implement features according to specifications
- Write unit tests alongside code
- Follow coding standards and patterns
- Document complex logic

### 3. Testing
- Write comprehensive unit tests
- Create integration tests where applicable
- Test edge cases and error scenarios
- Verify performance requirements
- Ensure accessibility compliance

### 4. Code Review
- Submit code for review
- Address review feedback
- Ensure code meets quality standards
- Update documentation

### 5. Integration
- Coordinate with other developer agents
- Test integration points
- Resolve conflicts
- Verify end-to-end functionality

## Coding Standards

### General Principles
- Write clean, self-documenting code
- Follow SOLID principles
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Implement proper error handling
- Write tests first (TDD approach)
- Document complex algorithms

### Code Organization
- Follow established project structure
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Keep functions small and focused
- Separate concerns appropriately
- Use dependency injection

### Testing Requirements
