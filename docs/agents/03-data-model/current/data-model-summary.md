# Data Model Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the data model design for Mile Quest, including key decisions, trade-offs, and implementation recommendations.

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Primary Key Strategy
**Decision**: Use UUIDs for all primary keys

**Rationale**:
- No sequential ID exposure
- Better for distributed systems
- Easier data migration
- No ID collisions when merging data

**Trade-off**: 
- Larger storage footprint (16 bytes vs 4/8 for integers)
- Slightly slower joins

### 2. Soft Deletes
**Decision**: Implement soft deletes for User and Team entities

**Rationale**:
- Audit trail requirements
- Data recovery capability
- Referential integrity for historical data

**Implementation**:
- `deletedAt` timestamp field
- Partial indexes with `WHERE deletedAt IS NULL`
- Application-level filtering

### 3. JSON Fields for Flexibility
**Decision**: Use JSON fields for:
- Route data (waypoints, segments)
- Achievement criteria
- Future extensibility

**Rationale**:
- Flexible schema for complex data
- Avoid excessive joins
- Easy to extend without migrations

**PostgreSQL Features**:
- GIN indexes for JSON queries
- JSON validation at application level

### 4. Aggregation Strategy
**Decision**: Maintain aggregate tables (UserStats, TeamProgress)

**Rationale**:
- Avoid expensive calculations on every request
- Better query performance
- Acceptable eventual consistency

**Update Strategy**:
- Update in same transaction as activity creation
- Consider async updates at scale
- Periodic reconciliation jobs

## Data Integrity Approach

### Application-Level Validations
1. **Prisma Schema Validations**
   - Type safety
   - Required fields
   - Enum constraints

2. **Business Logic Validations**
   - Team capacity checks
   - Distance/duration limits
   - Role-based permissions

3. **Database Constraints**
   - Unique constraints
   - Foreign key relationships
   - Check constraints (future)

### Transaction Boundaries

```typescript
// Critical transactions identified:
1. Activity Creation
   - Create activity
   - Update user stats
   - Update team progress
   - Check achievements

2. Team Member Management
   - Add/remove member
   - Ensure admin exists
   - Update counts

3. Goal Completion
   - Update goal status
   - Calculate final stats
   - Award achievements
```

## Performance Optimization Plan

### Phase 1: MVP Launch
- Basic indexes from Prisma
- Simple queries with selective includes
- CloudFront caching for read-heavy endpoints

### Phase 2: Growth (>1000 users)
- Add composite indexes
- Implement query result caching
- Connection pooling with PgBouncer

### Phase 3: Scale (>10k users)
- Read replicas for analytics
- Materialized views for leaderboards
- Consider Aurora migration

## Migration Strategy

### Initial Setup
```bash
# 1. Create database
createdb milequest

# 2. Run extensions
psql milequest -c "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS 'uuid-ossp';"
psql milequest -c "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS 'postgis';"

# 3. Run Prisma migrations
npx prisma migrate dev --name init

# 4. Seed initial data
npx prisma db seed
```

### Future Migrations
1. **Always test in staging first**
2. **Plan for zero-downtime migrations**
3. **Use expand-contract pattern**
4. **Version all migrations**

## Security Considerations

### Data Privacy
1. **PII Protection**
   - Email addresses indexed but encrypted at rest
   - No sensitive data in JSON fields
   - Activity locations optional

2. **Access Control**
   - Row-level security via application
   - Team-based data isolation
   - Admin-only operations validated

3. **Audit Trail**
   - Soft deletes preserve history
   - Updated timestamps on all records
   - Consider audit log table for sensitive operations

## Monitoring Plan

### Key Metrics
1. **Database Performance**
   - Query execution time
   - Connection pool usage
   - Table sizes and growth

2. **Data Quality**
   - Orphaned records
   - Stats accuracy
   - Constraint violations

3. **Usage Patterns**
   - Most active tables
   - Peak query times
   - Cache hit rates

### Alerts
```yaml
- Alert: Slow queries > 1s
- Alert: Connection pool > 80%
- Alert: Failed transactions
- Alert: Disk usage > 80%
```

## Future Enhancements

### Near Term (Next 3 months)
1. **Notification System**
   - New table for notifications
   - Real-time delivery tracking
   - Read/unread status

2. **Social Features**
   - Comments on activities
   - Likes/reactions
   - Activity sharing

### Long Term (6+ months)
1. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Time-series data for trends
   - Predictive goal completion
   - Team recommendations

2. **Global Expansion**
   - Multi-region data residency
   - Timezone handling improvements
   - Localized content storage

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Set up PostgreSQL with extensions
- [ ] Create Prisma schema file
- [ ] Generate Prisma client
- [ ] Create seed data scripts
- [ ] Implement data access layer
- [ ] Add monitoring queries
- [ ] Document backup procedures
- [ ] Create index analysis job
- [ ] Set up migration pipeline
- [ ] Performance test with realistic data

## Conclusion

The data model is designed to support Mile Quest's MVP requirements while providing clear paths for scaling. Key principles:

1. **Start Simple** - Basic schema that works
2. **Plan for Growth** - Indexes and patterns that scale
3. **Maintain Flexibility** - JSON fields for evolution
4. **Ensure Integrity** - Constraints and validations
5. **Monitor Everything** - Metrics and alerts from day one

This foundation supports rapid development while avoiding major refactoring as the application grows.
