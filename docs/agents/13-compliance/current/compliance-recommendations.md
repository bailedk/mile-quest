### For Review & Enhancement Agent (12)

**Current Score: 25% - CRITICAL NON-COMPLIANCE**

1. **Create STATE.json** in `/docs/agents/11-review-enhancement/`:
```json
{
  "agent": "Review & Enhancement",
  "agentNumber": 12,
  "currentVersion": "1.0",
  "status": "complete",
  "lastUpdated": "2025-01-12",

    {
      "name": "architecture-review.md",
      "description": "Architecture agent evaluation",
      "version": "1.0"

    }
  ],
  "dependencies": {
    "requires": ["Architecture Agent", "UI/UX Design Agent"],
    "provides": ["Review recommendations", "Integration concerns"]
  }
}
```

2. **Create CHANGELOG.md**:

3. **Reorganize files**:

   - Create empty `/versions/` and `/working/` folders

### For Data Model Agent (03)

**Current Score: 75%**

1. **Update AGENTS.md** - Change line 9:
   ```markdown
   | 3. Data Model | âœ… Complete | 100% | 2025-01-13 |
   ```

### For All Completed Agents (01, 02, 03, 12)

**Update CLAUDE.md** - Add after line 229:
```markdown
## Project Status Updates

- âœ… Review & Enhancement Agent (12) - v1.0 - Simplification recommendations

### Active Agent:

```

## Priority 2: Process Improvements

### 1. Create Completion Checklist Template

Add to `/docs/agents/completion-checklist.md`:
```markdown
# Agent Completion Checklist

Before marking your agent as complete, ensure:

## Documentation Structure
- [ ] All final docs moved from `working/` to `current/`
- [ ] Previous versions moved to `versions/vX.X/`
- [ ] STATE.json updated with status: "complete"
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md created/updated with all changes

## Project Updates
- [ ] AGENTS.md - Mark agent as âœ… Complete with date
- [ ] MANIFEST.md - Update all your docs to ðŸ“Œ Current
- [ ] CLAUDE.md - Add to completed agents list

## Final Deliverables
- [ ] All promised outputs delivered
- [ ] Dependencies documented in STATE.json
- [ ] Recommendations.md created for other agents
- [ ] No files outside your agent folder
```

### 2. STATE.json Template

Create `/docs/agents/STATE-template.json`:
```json
{
  "agent": "Agent Name",
  "agentNumber": 0,
  "currentVersion": "1.0",
  "previousVersion": null,
  "status": "pending|in-progress|complete",
  "lastUpdated": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "lastModifiedBy": "Agent Name",
  "description": "Brief description",
  "activeDocuments": [],
  "supersededDocuments": [],
  "keyDecisions": {},
  "dependencies": {
    "requires": [],
    "provides": []
  },
  "nextReview": "When...",
  "openQuestions": []
}
```

### 3. Business Analyst Agent (14) Updates

Update STATE.json to new format:
```json
{
  "agent": "Business Analyst",
  "agentNumber": 14,
  "currentVersion": "1.0",
  "status": "in-progress",
  "lastUpdated": "2025-01-15",
  "lastModifiedBy": "Business Analyst Agent",
  // ... rest of the structure
}
```

## Priority 3: Preventive Measures

### 1. Add to CLAUDE.md (line 52):
```markdown
### ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Agent Completion Requirements

**YOU MUST UPDATE THESE THREE FILES WHEN COMPLETE:**
1. âœ… AGENTS.md - Mark your row as complete
2. âœ… MANIFEST.md - Update your docs to Current
3. âœ… CLAUDE.md - Add to completed agents list

**FAILURE TO UPDATE = NON-COMPLIANCE**
```

### 2. Regular Compliance Audits

- Run compliance checks weekly
- Flag agents before they complete
- Provide compliance score in reviews

### 3. Git Hooks (Future)

Consider pre-commit hooks to verify:
- STATE.json exists for active agents
- Required folders present
- No files outside agent folders

## Compliance Scoring Rubric

For future reference, points are allocated as follows:
- Documentation Structure (25%)
  - STATE.json exists and correct: 10%
  - CHANGELOG.md exists: 5%
  - Folder structure correct: 10%
  
- Project Updates (30%)
  - AGENTS.md updated: 10%
  - MANIFEST.md updated: 10%
  - CLAUDE.md updated: 10%
  
- Technical Compliance (30%)
  - External service abstraction: 15%
  - Privacy patterns: 15%
  
- File Organization (15%)
  - Files in correct folders: 10%
  - Absolute paths used: 5%

## Next Steps

1. Review & Enhancement Agent must fix structure immediately
2. Data Model Agent should update AGENTS.md
3. All agents update CLAUDE.md
4. Future agents use templates
5. Weekly compliance reviews
