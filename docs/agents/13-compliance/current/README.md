## Running the Compliance Agent

### Automated Compliance Checking

Before performing manual audits, run the automated compliance checker:

```bash
# Using Node.js
cd docs/agents/13-compliance/scripts
node compliance-checker.js

# OR using Python
python3 compliance-checker.py
```

The automated scripts will:
- Check all agent documentation structure
- Validate STATE.json and backlog.json formats
- Verify project-wide file updates
- Generate a detailed compliance report
- Save results to `current/automated-compliance-report.json`

### Manual Audit Process

After running automated checks:
1. Review the automated report for patterns
2. Perform deeper analysis of violations
3. Check for compliance issues not caught by automation
4. Update the main compliance audit report
5. Add recommendations to agent backlogs

### When to Run

This agent should be run:
- Monthly (every 15th) as per schedule
- After 3+ agents complete major work
- Before major releases
- When new project rules are added
- When requested by user or other agents
