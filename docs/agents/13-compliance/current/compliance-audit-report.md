3. **Documentation Structure**
   - Must use current/, working/, versions/ folders
   - STATE.json and CHANGELOG.md required
   
4. **Project Status Updates**
   - Update AGENTS.md when complete
   - Update MANIFEST.md for documents
   - Update CLAUDE.md for project state
   
5. **File Organization**

**Note**: CLAUDE.md explicitly mentions this agent "completed work but missed updating AGENTS.md and MANIFEST.md, requiring manual fixes later."

### 4. Review & Enhancement Agent (12) - Score: 25%

**✅ Compliant Areas:**
- AGENTS.md shows as complete
- Files in designated folder

**❌ Non-Compliant Areas:**
- No STATE.json file (Critical)

- No versions/ or working/ folders
- Failed to update CLAUDE.md
- Documents not properly indexed in MANIFEST.md
- Non-standard file organization

**Critical Violations:**
- This agent completely ignores the required documentation structure
- Operating under old documentation standards

### 5. Business Analyst Agent (14) - Score: 62.5%

**✅ Compliant Areas:**
- Has STATE.json (though minimal)
- Has CHANGELOG.md
- Uses current/ folder structure
- Documents in MANIFEST.md
- Marked as "In Progress" in AGENTS.md

**❌ Non-Compliant Areas:**
- STATE.json uses old format (no agentNumber, currentVersion fields)
- Not yet complete, so CLAUDE.md update pending
- Missing versions/ folder structure

## Specific Violations by Category

### 1. External Service Abstraction
- ✅ Architecture Agent: Excellent pattern documentation
- ⚠️ Other agents: Not applicable yet (no implementation)

### 2. Privacy-Aware Queries
- ✅ Data Model Agent: Excellent implementation
- ✅ UI/UX Agent: Considered in designs
- ⚠️ Other agents: Not applicable

### 3. Documentation Structure
- ✅ Architecture, UI/UX, Data Model: Full compliance
- ⚠️ Business Analyst: Partial compliance
- ❌ Review & Enhancement: Complete non-compliance

### 4. Status Updates
- ❌ ALL AGENTS: Failed to update CLAUDE.md
- ❌ Data Model: Failed to update AGENTS.md
- ❌ Review & Enhancement: Multiple failures

### 5. File Organization
- ✅ All agents: Files in correct folders
- ✅ All agents: Using absolute paths

## Recommendations for Fixes

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Review & Enhancement Agent (12)**
   - Create STATE.json with proper format
   - Create CHANGELOG.md documenting work
   - Reorganize files into current/ folder
   - Create versions/ and working/ folders
   - Update MANIFEST.md entries

2. **Data Model Agent (03)**
   - Update AGENTS.md to show 100% complete
   - Add completion note to CLAUDE.md

3. **All Completed Agents**
   - Update CLAUDE.md to reflect completion

### Process Improvements

1. **Create Completion Checklist**
   ```markdown
   - [ ] Move docs from working/ to current/
   - [ ] Update STATE.json status to "complete"
   - [ ] Create/update CHANGELOG.md
   - [ ] Update AGENTS.md to ✅ Complete
   - [ ] Update MANIFEST.md doc status
   - [ ] Update CLAUDE.md project state
   - [ ] Create recommendations.md
   ```

2. **Automated Compliance Checks**
   - Script to verify STATE.json exists
   - Check for required folders
   - Validate AGENTS.md updates

3. **Agent Training**
   - Emphasize CLAUDE.md as source of truth
   - Regular compliance reminders
   - Clear examples of proper structure

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- Review & Enhancement Agent's non-compliance sets bad precedent
- Missing CLAUDE.md updates cause confusion about project state

### Medium Risk
- Inconsistent STATE.json formats
- Missing AGENTS.md updates

### Low Risk
- Minor documentation gaps
- Version folder organization

## Conclusion

While agents demonstrate strong technical compliance (external service abstraction, privacy patterns), administrative compliance is poor. The most critical issue is the universal failure to update CLAUDE.md upon completion, which is explicitly listed as a critical requirement.

The Review & Enhancement Agent, ironically responsible for quality, has the worst compliance score at 25%. This must be addressed immediately to maintain project standards.

**Overall Project Compliance Score: 67.6%** (Grade: D+)
