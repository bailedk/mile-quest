# Mile Quest Security Implementation Plan

**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: 2025-01-17  
**Agent**: Security & Privacy Agent (06)  
**Status**: In Progress

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive security implementation plan for Mile Quest, focusing on authentication, authorization, API security, and privacy controls. The implementation follows the Architecture Agent's external service abstraction pattern and addresses all security requirements identified by the API Designer.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Authentication Service Abstraction (Week 1)
- Implement AuthService interface following external service abstraction pattern
- Create Cognito adapter implementation
- Build mock implementation for testing
- Set up service factory with environment-based provider selection

### Phase 2: API Security Middleware (Week 1)
- Implement JWT token validation middleware
- Create rate limiting middleware with Redis backing
- Set up CORS configuration
- Add security headers middleware

### Phase 3: Authorization System (Week 2)
- Implement team-based permissions
- Create authorization middleware
- Build permission checking utilities
- Set up role-based access control

### Phase 4: Privacy Controls (Week 2)
- Implement privacy-aware queries
- Create activity privacy management
- Build user privacy preferences
- Ensure GDPR compliance

## Key Security Components

### 1. Authentication Service Abstraction

Following the Architecture Agent's mandate, we will abstract AWS Cognito behind a clean interface:

```typescript
interface AuthService {
  // Core authentication
  signIn(email: string, password: string): Promise<AuthUser>;
  signUp(email: string, password: string, name: string): Promise<AuthUser>;
  signOut(): Promise<void>;
  
  // Email verification
  verifyEmail(email: string, code: string): Promise<void>;
  resendVerificationCode(email: string): Promise<void>;
  
  // Password management
  forgotPassword(email: string): Promise<void>;
  resetPassword(email: string, code: string, newPassword: string): Promise<void>;
  
  // Session management
  getCurrentUser(): Promise<AuthUser | null>;
  refreshToken(refreshToken: string): Promise<TokenResponse>;
  
  // Token operations
  validateToken(token: string): Promise<boolean>;
  decodeToken(token: string): Promise<TokenPayload>;
}
```

### 2. Rate Limiting Strategy

Based on API Designer specifications:
- **Authenticated requests**: 600/hour per user
- **Activity logging**: 60/hour per user  
- **Team creation**: 10/day per user
- **Auth endpoints**: 20/hour per IP

Implementation using Redis:
```typescript
interface RateLimitConfig {
  windowMs: number;
  max: number;
  keyGenerator: (req: Request) => string;
  skipSuccessfulRequests?: boolean;
}
```

### 3. API Security Headers

All responses will include:
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`
- `Content-Security-Policy: [policy]`

### 4. CORS Configuration

Following API Designer's specifications:
- Origin: Only PWA domain (no wildcards)
- Credentials: true
- Methods: GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE
- Headers: Content-Type, Authorization, X-Client-Version

### 5. Authorization Model

Team-based permissions:
```typescript
enum TeamRole {
  ADMIN = 'ADMIN',
  MEMBER = 'MEMBER'
}

interface TeamPermissions {
  canEditTeam: boolean;
  canInviteMembers: boolean;
  canRemoveMembers: boolean;
  canEditGoals: boolean;
  canManageWaypoints: boolean;
}
```

### 6. Privacy Implementation

Following Data Model Agent's privacy requirements:
- Private activities always count toward team goals
- User stats respect privacy settings
- Activity feeds exclude private activities
- Users can toggle privacy on their activities

## Security Middleware Stack

```typescript
// Execution order for API routes
app.use(securityHeaders());
app.use(cors(corsConfig));
app.use(rateLimiter(rateLimitConfig));
app.use(authenticateRequest());
app.use(authorizeRequest());
app.use(validateInput());
```

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1
- [ ] Create auth service interface
- [ ] Implement Cognito adapter
- [ ] Build mock auth service
- [ ] Create rate limiting middleware
- [ ] Implement security headers

### Week 2  
- [ ] Build authorization middleware
- [ ] Implement team permissions
- [ ] Create privacy controls
- [ ] Add input validation
- [ ] Security testing

## Security Checklist

### Authentication
- [ ] Password complexity requirements (min 8 chars, mixed case, number)
- [ ] Account lockout after failed attempts
- [ ] Secure password reset flow
- [ ] Email verification required
- [ ] Session timeout configuration

### API Security
- [ ] JWT token validation
- [ ] Token expiration (1 hour)
- [ ] Refresh token rotation
- [ ] Rate limiting per endpoint
- [ ] CORS properly configured

### Data Protection
- [ ] Input validation on all endpoints
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (via Prisma)
- [ ] XSS prevention
- [ ] Sensitive data encryption
- [ ] Audit logging

### Privacy
- [ ] Privacy flag on activities
- [ ] Privacy-aware queries
- [ ] GDPR compliance
- [ ] Data export capability
- [ ] Account deletion

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Auth service mock testing
- Middleware function tests
- Permission checking tests
- Privacy filter tests

### Integration Tests
- Full auth flow testing
- Rate limiter effectiveness
- CORS configuration
- Token refresh flow

### Security Tests
- Penetration testing
- OWASP vulnerability scan
- Token security validation
- Rate limit bypass attempts

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Security Metrics
- Failed login attempts
- Rate limit violations
- Invalid token attempts
- Suspicious activity patterns

### Alert Triggers
- Multiple failed logins
- Rate limit exceeded
- Invalid JWT signatures
- Unusual access patterns

## Compliance Requirements

### GDPR
- User consent for data processing
- Right to access data
- Right to delete account
- Data portability
- Privacy by design

### Security Standards
- OWASP Top 10 compliance
- HTTPS everywhere
- Secure cookie configuration
- Content Security Policy

## Dependencies

### Required Services
- AWS Cognito (authentication)
- Redis (rate limiting, sessions)
- AWS CloudWatch (monitoring)
- AWS SES (email verification)

### Required Packages
- `jsonwebtoken` - JWT handling
- `bcrypt` - Password hashing (backup)
- `express-rate-limit` - Rate limiting
- `helmet` - Security headers
- `cors` - CORS middleware

## Risk Mitigation

### High Priority Risks
1. **Token theft** - Mitigated by short expiration, secure storage
2. **Brute force** - Mitigated by rate limiting, account lockout
3. **Data breach** - Mitigated by encryption, access controls
4. **Privacy violation** - Mitigated by privacy controls, audit logs

### Medium Priority Risks
1. **Session hijacking** - Mitigated by secure cookies, HTTPS
2. **CSRF attacks** - Mitigated by token validation
3. **API abuse** - Mitigated by rate limiting
4. **Unauthorized access** - Mitigated by proper authorization

## Next Steps

1. Review plan with Architecture Agent
2. Create detailed auth service interface
3. Begin Cognito adapter implementation
4. Set up development environment for testing
5. Create security test suite

## Success Criteria

- All authentication flows working with abstracted service
- Rate limiting effectively preventing abuse
- Zero security vulnerabilities in OWASP scan
- 100% test coverage on security components
- Privacy controls fully implemented
- GDPR compliance verified
