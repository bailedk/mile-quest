# Security & Privacy Agent Changelog

## v1.2 - Logging Security Review Complete (2025-01-19)

### Added
- Comprehensive logging security review and best practices documentation
- Security recommendations for logging implementation
- Updated recommendations for DevOps, Testing, and Backend teams

### Deliverables
- `current/logging-security-review.md` - Complete security analysis of logging implementation

### Key Findings
- ✅ Current logging implementation follows security best practices
- ✅ No passwords, tokens, or sensitive data logged
- ✅ Proper error sanitization in place
- ✅ CloudWatch configuration is secure with appropriate retention
- ✅ Structured JSON logging enables security monitoring

### Recommendations Issued
- Implement logging guards for automatic sensitive data redaction
- Add security event logging methods
- Configure CloudWatch alarms for security events
- Add pre-commit hooks for sensitive pattern detection
- Create security-focused test cases

### Status
- Completed backend developer request for logging security review
- Updated backlog item sec-001 to completed status
- Added new recommendations to recommendations.md

## v1.1 - Security Planning Complete (2025-01-17)

### Added
- Comprehensive security implementation plan
- Authentication service abstraction design (following Architecture patterns)
- API security middleware specifications
- Privacy controls implementation guide
- Security recommendations for other agents

### Deliverables
- `working/security-implementation-plan.md` - 4-phase implementation strategy
- `working/auth-service-abstraction.md` - Vendor-agnostic auth with Cognito adapter
- `working/api-security-middleware.md` - Rate limiting, CORS, headers, auth middleware
- `working/privacy-controls.md` - Privacy features and GDPR compliance
- `working/security-summary.md` - Work summary and next steps
- `recommendations.md` - Security guidance for other agents

### Key Decisions
- Abstract AWS Cognito behind AuthService interface for vendor flexibility
- Use Redis for distributed rate limiting across Lambda instances
- Implement privacy-aware queries respecting isPrivate flag
- JWT-based authentication with 1-hour token expiration
- Comprehensive security headers including strict CSP

### Integration Points Validated
- ✅ Architecture: Follows external service abstraction pattern
- ✅ API Designer: Implements specified rate limits and auth flows
- ✅ Data Model: Respects privacy flags and data patterns

### Next Phase
- Move working documents to current/
- Begin implementation starting with auth service abstraction
- Coordinate with DevOps for Redis and Cognito setup
