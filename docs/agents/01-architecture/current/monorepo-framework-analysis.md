# Monorepo Framework Analysis for AWS Amplify

## Current Plan: pnpm + Turborepo

Our current documentation mentions using **pnpm** with **Turborepo**, which was likely chosen when considering Vercel deployment. Let's analyze if this is still the best choice with AWS Amplify.

## Monorepo Framework Options

### 1. Turborepo (Current Plan)
**Pros:**
- Excellent caching system
- Fast parallel builds
- Great with Next.js
- Simple configuration
- Good AWS Amplify support

**Cons:**
- Primarily optimized for Vercel workflows
- Some features overlap with Amplify's build system
- Additional complexity layer

**AWS Amplify Compatibility:** ✅ Good

### 2. Nx
**Pros:**
- More comprehensive tooling
- Better for large monorepos
- Excellent dependency graph visualization
- Strong AWS CDK integration
- Built-in generators for AWS Lambda
- Better for backend-heavy monorepos

**Cons:**
- Steeper learning curve
- More configuration required
- Can be overkill for smaller projects

**AWS Amplify Compatibility:** ✅ Excellent

### 3. pnpm Workspaces (Native)
**Pros:**
- No additional build tool needed
- Simplest setup
- Native pnpm feature
- Less abstraction
- Works perfectly with Amplify

**Cons:**
- No built-in caching (rely on Amplify's cache)
- No parallel task orchestration
- Manual script coordination

**AWS Amplify Compatibility:** ✅ Excellent

### 4. Rush
**Pros:**
- Enterprise-grade
- Excellent for large teams
- Strong versioning support
- Good with AWS

**Cons:**
- Complex setup
- Overkill for MVP
- Steep learning curve

**AWS Amplify Compatibility:** ✅ Good

## Recommendation for Mile Quest

### For MVP: **pnpm Workspaces (Native)**

Given our AWS Amplify deployment, I recommend starting with **native pnpm workspaces** without Turborepo for these reasons:

1. **Simplicity**: One less tool to configure and maintain
2. **Amplify Build Cache**: Amplify provides its own build caching
3. **Sufficient for MVP**: Our monorepo is small (1 app, 5 packages)
4. **Easy Migration**: Can add Nx later if needed
5. **Cost Effective**: No additional complexity overhead

### Implementation Structure

```yaml
# pnpm-workspace.yaml
packages:
  - 'apps/*'
  - 'packages/*'
  - 'infrastructure/*'
```

```json
// package.json (root)
{
  "name": "mile-quest",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "pnpm --filter @mile-quest/web dev",
    "build": "pnpm --filter @mile-quest/web build",
    "test": "pnpm -r test",
    "lint": "pnpm -r lint",
    "type-check": "pnpm -r type-check",
    "clean": "pnpm -r clean",
    "deploy:backend": "pnpm --filter @mile-quest/infrastructure deploy"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/node": "^20.0.0",
    "typescript": "^5.0.0"
  }
}
```

└── .npmrc                          # pnpm config
```

### Amplify Configuration
```yaml
# amplify.yml
version: 1
applications:
  - appRoot: apps/web
    frontend:
      phases:
        preBuild:
          commands:
            - npm install -g pnpm
            - pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
        build:
          commands:
            # Build shared dependencies first
            - pnpm --filter @mile-quest/shared build
            - pnpm --filter @mile-quest/ui build
            # Then build the app
            - pnpm --filter @mile-quest/web build
      artifacts:
        baseDirectory: apps/web/.next
        files:
          - '**/*'
      cache:
        paths:
          - node_modules/**/*
          - .pnpm-store/**/*
          - packages/*/node_modules/**/*
          - packages/*/dist/**/*
```

## Migration Path

### Phase 1: Start Simple (MVP)
- Use pnpm workspaces only
- Focus on getting to market
- Rely on Amplify's caching

### Phase 2: Add Build Tool (If Needed)
When to consider adding Nx:
- More than 5 packages
- Build times exceed 5 minutes
- Need better task orchestration
- Multiple team members

### Phase 3: Enterprise Scale
- Consider Nx for complex dependency management
- Add custom generators for Lambda functions
- Implement affected builds

## Key Differences from Vercel Setup

1. **Build Caching**: Amplify handles this, less need for Turborepo
2. **Deployment**: Amplify manages frontend, CDK manages backend
3. **Preview Deployments**: Amplify provides this natively
4. **Environment Variables**: Managed in Amplify Console

## Decision Matrix

| Criteria | pnpm Only | Turborepo | Nx |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-----|
| Setup Complexity | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ |
| AWS Integration | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Build Speed (Small) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Build Speed (Large) | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Learning Curve | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ |
| Future Proof | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

## Conclusion

For Mile Quest MVP with AWS Amplify:
1. **Start with native pnpm workspaces** - simplest, fastest to implement
2. **Monitor build times** - Amplify's caching may be sufficient
3. **Add Nx later if needed** - When complexity justifies it

This approach aligns with our "build for 1,000 users, design for 1,000,000" philosophy.
