# Infrastructure Cost Monitoring

**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: 2025-01-15  
**Author**: Architecture Agent  
**Target Budget**: $70/month

## Current Cost Projections

### MVP Infrastructure Costs (Monthly)

| Service | Component | Cost | Notes |
|---------|-----------|------|-------|
| **Compute** | | | |
| AWS Lambda | API Functions | $5-10 | ~1M requests/month |
| Amplify Hosting | Next.js App | $12 | Including build minutes |
| **Database** | | | |
| RDS PostgreSQL | db.t3.micro | $15 | Single AZ for MVP |
| RDS Storage | 20GB gp3 | $3 | Growing ~1GB/month |
| **Caching** | | | |
| CloudFront | CDN | $5 | ~100GB transfer |
| **Auth** | | | |
| Cognito | User Pool | $0 | First 50K MAU free |
| **Real-time** | | | |
| Pusher | Channels | $0 | Free tier (100 connections) |
| **Storage** | | | |
| S3 | Static Assets | $1 | Profile pictures, etc |
| **Monitoring** | | | |
| CloudWatch | Logs/Metrics | $5 | Basic monitoring |
| **Total** | | **$46-51** | Well under $70 budget |

### Cost Optimization Strategies

#### 1. Database Optimization
- **Current**: db.t3.micro ($15/month)
- **If needed**: Use Aurora Serverless v2 (scales to zero)
- **Savings**: Potential 50% reduction during low usage

#### 2. Lambda Optimization
- **Bundling**: Minimize cold starts with optimized bundles
- **Memory**: Right-size Lambda memory (512MB optimal)
- **Provisioned Concurrency**: Only if needed (adds $5-10/month)

#### 3. Caching Strategy
- **CloudFront**: Cache all public data (5-minute TTL)
- **API Responses**: Cache dashboard endpoint
- **Static Assets**: 1-year cache headers

### Growth Projections

#### 100 Active Teams (2,500 users)
| Service | Scaled Cost | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Lambda | $15-20 | ~3M requests |
| RDS | $35 | db.t3.small + 100GB |
| CloudFront | $10 | More traffic |
| Pusher | $49 | Paid tier needed |
| **Total** | **$109-114** | Need optimization |

#### Cost Reduction Options at Scale
1. **Reserved Instances**: 30% savings on RDS
2. **Savings Plans**: 20% on Lambda
3. **Self-host WebSockets**: Save Pusher costs
4. **Read Replicas**: Distribute load

### Monitoring Implementation

#### CloudWatch Dashboards
```json
{
  "widgets": [
    {
      "type": "metric",
      "properties": {
        "metrics": [
          ["AWS/Lambda", "Invocations", {"stat": "Sum"}],
          ["AWS/RDS", "DatabaseConnections", {"stat": "Average"}],
          ["AWS/CloudFront", "BytesDownloaded", {"stat": "Sum"}]
        ],
        "period": 86400,
        "stat": "Average",
        "region": "us-west-2",
        "title": "Daily Usage Metrics"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Cost Alerts
- Alert at $50/month (70% of budget)
- Alert at $65/month (93% of budget)
- Daily cost emails to team

### Recommendations

#### Immediate Actions
1. **Set up AWS Budgets** with alerts
2. **Enable Cost Explorer** for detailed tracking
3. **Tag all resources** with `project:milequest`
4. **Review weekly** during MVP phase

#### Future Considerations
1. **Multi-Region**: Only if latency issues (doubles costs)
2. **Auto-scaling**: RDS auto-scaling when needed
3. **Spot Instances**: For batch processing (70% savings)
4. **CDN Optimization**: Use Cloudflare if cheaper

### Cost Review Schedule

- **Weekly**: During MVP development
- **Bi-weekly**: Post-launch
- **Monthly**: Stable operations

### Current Status: âœ… ON BUDGET

**Projected MVP Cost**: $46-51/month  
**Budget**: $70/month  
**Headroom**: $19-24/month (27-34%)

The infrastructure is well within budget with room for growth. The architecture's serverless approach provides excellent cost efficiency at low scale while maintaining the ability to scale when needed.
