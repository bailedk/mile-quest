# API Versioning Strategy

**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: 2025-01-15  
**Author**: Architecture Agent  
**Status**: Approved

## Executive Summary

After analyzing the technical constraints and requirements, I recommend **URL-based versioning** (`/api/v1/...`) for Mile Quest's API. This approach provides the best balance of simplicity, compatibility with Next.js App Router, and developer experience.

## Decision: URL Versioning

### Final Pattern
```
/api/v1/auth/login
/api/v1/teams
/api/v1/activities
```

### Rationale

1. **Next.js App Router Compatibility**
   - Natural fit with file-based routing
   - Easy to implement with route groups
   - Clear separation of versions in codebase

2. **Developer Experience**
   - Immediately visible in URLs
   - Easy to debug and test
   - Works well with browser tools
   - Simple to document

3. **CloudFront Caching**
   - Different cache behaviors per version
   - Easy to purge specific versions
   - Clear cache keys

4. **Client Implementation**
   - Simple base URL configuration
   - No special headers required
   - Works with all HTTP clients

## Implementation Guidelines

### Directory Structure
```
app/
├── api/
│   ├── v1/
│   │   ├── auth/
│   │   │   ├── login/route.ts
│   │   │   ├── register/route.ts
│   │   │   └── refresh/route.ts
│   │   ├── teams/
│   │   │   └── route.ts
│   │   └── activities/
│   │       └── route.ts
│   └── v2/ (future)
```

### Version Lifecycle

1. **Version Introduction**
   - New versions only for breaking changes
   - Non-breaking changes added to current version
   - Beta endpoints can use `/api/v1-beta/...`

2. **Version Support**
   - Support current and previous version (n-1)
   - 6-month deprecation notice
   - Clear migration guides

3. **Breaking Changes**
   - Response structure changes
   - Removed fields
   - Changed authentication methods
   - Modified business logic

### Non-Breaking Changes
These can be added to existing versions:
- New optional fields
- New endpoints
- Additional response data
- Performance improvements

## Migration Strategy

### Client Detection
```typescript
// Response header indicates available versions
X-API-Versions: v1,v2
X-API-Current: v2
X-API-Deprecated: v1
```

### Deprecation Headers
```typescript
// When using deprecated version
X-API-Deprecation-Date: 2025-12-31
X-API-Upgrade-Guide: https://docs.milequest.run/api/v2-migration
```

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### Header Versioning
```
X-API-Version: 1
```
**Rejected because:**
- Hidden from URLs
- Harder to debug
- Requires header management in all clients
- Complex with CloudFront

### Accept Header Versioning
```
Accept: application/vnd.milequest.v1+json
```
**Rejected because:**
- Too complex for MVP
- Poor browser support
- Difficult to test manually
- Over-engineered for our needs

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Update API Designer contracts with v1 prefix
- [ ] Configure Next.js route groups
- [ ] Set up CloudFront behaviors
- [ ] Update client SDK base URLs
- [ ] Document versioning policy
- [ ] Create migration guide template

## Future Considerations

### Version 2 Triggers
Potential changes that would require v2:
- GraphQL introduction
- Major authentication overhaul
- Fundamental data model changes
- Breaking pagination changes

### Beta Program
For experimental features:
- Use `/api/v1-beta/...` prefix
- Clearly marked as unstable
- No SLA guarantees
- Can be removed without notice

## Recommendations for API Designer

1. **Update all endpoint paths** to include `/v1`
2. **Add version detection** endpoint: `GET /api/versions`
3. **Include deprecation headers** in response interceptor
4. **Plan for version negotiation** in client SDKs

## Cost Implications

- Minimal infrastructure impact
- CloudFront configuration is straightforward
- No additional Lambda complexity
- Clear separation aids monitoring

## Conclusion

URL versioning provides the optimal solution for Mile Quest's API, balancing simplicity, developer experience, and technical constraints. This approach will serve us well through MVP and beyond, with clear paths for future evolution.
