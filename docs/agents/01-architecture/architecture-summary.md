# Architecture Agent Summary

## Executive Summary

The Architecture Agent has completed research and design for Mile Quest's technical architecture, focusing on AWS serverless services to minimize costs while maintaining scalability.

## Key Deliverables

### 1. AWS Architecture (`aws-architecture.md`)
- **Serverless-first approach** using Lambda, API Gateway, and Aurora Serverless
- **Cost projections**: $35/month (MVP) → $180/month (1K users) → $900/month (10K users)
- **Service selection** optimized for pay-per-use pricing
- **Free tier maximization** for early stage growth

### 2. Serverless Design (`serverless-design.md`)
- **Lambda function organization** by business domain
- **Event-driven architecture** with SQS, SNS, and EventBridge
- **API patterns** for REST and WebSocket endpoints
- **Cost optimization techniques** including ARM processors and caching

### 3. Domain Setup (`domain-setup.md`)
- **Route 53 configuration** for mile-quest.com
- **CloudFront distribution** with security headers
- **SSL/TLS setup** with ACM certificates
- **Subdomain strategy** for environments and services

### 4. Infrastructure Diagrams (`infrastructure-diagram.md`)
- **High-level architecture** showing all AWS services
- **Data flow diagrams** for different request paths
- **Security architecture** with WAF and Shield
- **Disaster recovery** plan with multi-region setup

### 5. Technology Stack (`tech-stack.md`)
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Mapbox GL
- **Backend**: Node.js Lambda, Fastify, Prisma ORM
- **Infrastructure**: AWS CDK, GitHub Actions, Docker
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch, X-Ray, Sentry

## Architecture Highlights

### Cost Optimization
- Serverless services eliminate idle compute costs
- Aurora Serverless auto-pauses when inactive
- Aggressive CloudFront caching reduces backend load
- DynamoDB for session storage (more cost-effective than Redis for this use case)

### Scalability
- Lambda auto-scales to handle any load
- API Gateway manages 10,000 requests/second
- Aurora Serverless scales from 0.5 to 16 ACUs
- CloudFront handles global traffic distribution

### Developer Experience
- Monorepo with Turborepo for efficient builds
- TypeScript across frontend and backend
- Local development with AWS SAM and LocalStack
- Automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions

### Security
- AWS WAF for application protection
- Cognito for authentication and authorization
- VPC isolation for database
- Encryption at rest and in transit

## Next Steps for Other Agents

### UI/UX Design Agent
- Review mobile-first constraints in tech stack
- Consider PWA capabilities for offline design
- Design within Mapbox GL JS limitations

### Data Model Agent
- Design schema for Aurora PostgreSQL
- Plan PostGIS usage for geospatial data
- Consider DynamoDB patterns for real-time data

### DevOps Agent
- Implement AWS CDK infrastructure
- Set up GitHub Actions pipelines
- Configure monitoring and alerts

### Security Agent
- Implement Cognito user pools
- Design team-based permissions
- Set up WAF rules

## Questions Resolved

1. **GraphQL vs REST?** → REST chosen for simplicity, with option to add GraphQL later
2. **Microservices vs Monolith?** → Modular monolith with Lambda functions
3. **Expected scale?** → Architecture supports 10K+ active users

## Cost Control Measures

1. **Budget Alerts**: Set at $50, $100, $500 monthly
2. **Auto-scaling Limits**: Configured to prevent runaway costs
3. **Reserved Capacity**: Consider after 6 months of stable usage
4. **Monitoring**: Daily cost analysis with anomaly detection

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Vendor Lock-in**: Core logic abstracted from AWS services
2. **Cold Starts**: Minimized with provisioned concurrency for critical paths
3. **Data Loss**: Automated backups with point-in-time recovery
4. **Regional Outage**: Multi-region failover capability

The architecture is ready for implementation, providing a solid foundation that balances cost-efficiency, scalability, and developer productivity.
