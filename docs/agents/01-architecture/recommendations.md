# Architecture Agent Recommendations

**Date**: 2025-01-15  
**From**: Architecture Agent (01)

## For API Designer Agent (04)

### API Versioning Implementation
**Priority**: Completed ✅  
**Decision**: URL-based versioning (/api/v1/)  
**Next Steps**:
- Update all endpoint definitions to include /v1 prefix
- Configure Next.js route groups for version separation
- Plan version lifecycle documentation

## For DevOps Agent (11)

### Infrastructure Monitoring Setup
**Priority**: High  
**Request**: Implement cost and performance monitoring  
**Key Metrics**:
- Lambda invocation counts and duration
- RDS connection pool usage
- CloudFront cache hit rates
- Monthly cost tracking against $70 budget

**Recommended Tools**:
- AWS Budget alerts at $50 and $65
- CloudWatch dashboards for real-time metrics
- Cost Explorer for detailed analysis

### Deployment Pipeline Optimization
**Priority**: Medium  
**Considerations**:
- Optimize Lambda bundle sizes (target <5MB)
- Implement blue-green deployments for zero downtime
- Cache node_modules in CI/CD pipeline
- Use AWS CodeBuild for native integration

## For Security Agent (06)

### Security Hardening Checklist
**Priority**: High  
**Architecture Constraints**:
- All Lambdas run in VPC with security groups
- RDS requires SSL connections only
- API Gateway with request throttling
- Consider AWS WAF for additional protection

### Secrets Management
**Priority**: High  
**Pattern**: Use AWS Secrets Manager  
- Database credentials rotation
- API keys for external services
- JWT signing keys
- Never store secrets in environment variables

## For Data Model Agent (03)

### Performance Recommendations
**Priority**: Completed ✅  
**Validated**:
- Real-time aggregation pattern approved
- Current indexes sufficient for MVP
- Consider read replicas only at >10K users

### Future Scaling Considerations
**Priority**: Low (Post-MVP)  
**When to Act**:
- Implement sharding at >1M activities
- Add read replicas at >100 req/sec
- Consider time-series DB at >10M activities

## For Mobile Optimization Agent (07)

### PWA Performance Targets
**Priority**: High  
**Architecture Support**:
- CloudFront caching for all static assets
- Lambda@Edge for dynamic optimization
- Service Worker for offline support
- Target <3s initial load on 3G

### API Optimization
**Priority**: Medium  
**Patterns**:
- Implement request batching for offline sync
- Use compression for all API responses
- Consider Protocol Buffers for binary efficiency (future)

## For Integration Agent (08)

### External Service Guidelines
**Priority**: High  
**Mandatory Pattern**: Service abstraction  
```typescript
// Never import directly
import Pusher from 'pusher-js'; // ❌

// Always use abstraction
import { WebSocketService } from '@/services/websocket'; // ✅
```

**Current Abstractions Needed**:
- WebSocketService (Pusher)
- AuthService (Cognito)
- EmailService (SES)
- MapsService (Mapbox)

## For Testing & QA Agent (10)

### Performance Testing Targets
**Priority**: High  
**Based on Architecture Analysis**:
- API response time p95 < 200ms
- Dashboard load time < 500ms
- Activity creation < 100ms
- Support 100 concurrent users per team

### Load Testing Scenarios
**Priority**: Medium  
**Test Cases**:
1. 50 users logging activities simultaneously
2. Dashboard requests during peak hours
3. WebSocket connection storms
4. Database connection pool exhaustion

## Process Improvements

### Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
**Recommendation**: Implement ADR process  
**Benefits**:
- Track why decisions were made
- Easy onboarding for new team members
- Clear migration paths

### Cost Review Process
**Frequency**: Weekly during MVP, then monthly  
**Actions**:
- Review AWS Cost Explorer
- Check against projections
- Identify optimization opportunities
- Report to team if >80% of budget

### Scaling Triggers Documentation
**Maintain Clear Thresholds**:
- Document all scaling triggers in one place
- Set up automated alerts before thresholds
- Plan migration paths in advance
- Test scaling procedures quarterly

These recommendations ensure the architecture remains performant, cost-effective, and scalable while maintaining development velocity.
