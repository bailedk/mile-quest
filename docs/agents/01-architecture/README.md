# Architecture Agent Documentation

## Overview
This folder contains all architectural decisions, designs, and technical specifications for the Mile Quest platform.

## Status
- **Current Phase**: Architecture Research Complete
- **Last Updated**: 2025-01-12
- **Agent**: Architecture Agent

## Completed Work
- [x] AWS services selection for cost-effective architecture
- [x] Serverless-first architecture design
- [x] Domain setup plan for mile-quest.com
- [x] Detailed infrastructure diagrams
- [x] Technology stack finalization
- [x] API architecture with Lambda functions
- [x] Cost estimates ($35/month MVP â†’ $900/month at scale)
- [x] Monorepo structure with AWS CDK

## Key Architecture Decisions
1. **Serverless-First**: Lambda + API Gateway for zero idle costs
2. **Aurora Serverless v2**: Auto-scaling PostgreSQL with PostGIS
3. **Multi-Service Approach**: SQS, EventBridge, DynamoDB for specific use cases
4. **CDN Strategy**: CloudFront with aggressive caching
5. **Real-time**: WebSocket API with DynamoDB + ElastiCache

## Key Decisions
1. **Monorepo Structure**: Chosen for code sharing, atomic changes, and simplified development
2. **Tech Stack**: Next.js 14 (frontend), Fastify (backend), PostgreSQL with PostGIS (database)
3. **Real-time**: Socket.io for WebSocket communications
4. **Cache**: Redis with BullMQ for job queuing

## Dependencies
- None (Architecture Agent runs first)

## Output for Other Agents
- All agents should reference `tech-stack.md` for technology choices
- UI/UX Agent should consider mobile-first constraints in `api-design.md`
- DevOps Agent should implement infrastructure based on `deployment.md`

## Questions for Team
- Should we consider GraphQL instead of REST for better mobile data fetching?
- Do we need a separate service for heavy geospatial calculations?
- What's the expected scale (users, teams, requests/second)?
