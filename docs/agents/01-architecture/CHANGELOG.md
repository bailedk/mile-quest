# Architecture Agent Changelog

All notable changes to the Architecture documentation will be documented in this file.

## [2.1] - 2025-01-19

### Added (2025-01-19)
- **CSS Architecture Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis of CSS/SCSS approaches for Next.js
- `css-architecture-analysis.md` - Complete CSS architecture recommendations including:
  - Build pipeline and tooling analysis (Turbopack vs Webpack)
  - Bundle optimization strategies
  - Runtime vs build-time CSS processing comparison
  - Caching and CDN optimization approaches
  - CSS splitting and lazy loading patterns
  - Integration with Next.js App Router, RSC, and ISR
  - Performance monitoring and metrics

### Key CSS Architecture Recommendations
- Primary: Tailwind CSS with JIT compilation for utility-first approach
- Secondary: CSS Modules for complex component-specific styles
- Build Tool: Turbopack (Next.js 15+) with Lightning CSS
- Zero-runtime CSS strategy for optimal serverless performance
- Aggressive caching with content-based hashing
- Core Web Vitals monitoring with CSS-specific metrics

## [2.1] - 2025-01-15

### Added
- **API Versioning Strategy**: Defined URL-based versioning approach (/api/v1/)
- **Performance Analysis**: Validated activity aggregation patterns can handle scale
- **Cost Monitoring**: Created ongoing infrastructure cost tracking system
- `api-versioning-strategy.md` - Complete versioning implementation guide
- `activity-aggregation-performance-analysis.md` - Aggregation performance assessment
- `infrastructure-cost-monitoring.md` - Cost tracking and projections

### Resolved
- API versioning approach (was open question)
- Activity aggregation performance concerns
- Infrastructure cost tracking process

### Key Findings
- Current architecture supports 100 activities/second
- Infrastructure costs projected at $46-51/month (well under $70 budget)
- Real-time aggregation pattern validated for scale

### Updated
- STATE.json to version 2.1 with new documents
- Resolved API versioning open question
- Added new open questions about WAF and read replicas

## [2.0] - 2025-01-12

### Changed
- **Major Simplification**: Reduced architecture complexity by 75% based on Review Agent recommendations
- Switched from Aurora Serverless v2 to RDS PostgreSQL Multi-AZ (60% cost reduction)
- Replaced custom WebSocket infrastructure with Pusher managed service (80% cost reduction)
- Removed ElastiCache from MVP, relying on CloudFront only (100% cost reduction)
- Deferred GraphQL implementation, using REST with field filtering
- Total infrastructure cost reduced from $250-600/month to $70-150/month

### Added
- Clear migration triggers for scaling decisions
- `mvp-architecture.md` - Simplified architecture documentation
- `infrastructure-diagram-mvp.md` - New simplified infrastructure diagram
- `architecture-decisions-v2.md` - Detailed evaluation of each recommendation
- `summary-v2.md` - Executive summary of changes

### Deprecated
- Original Aurora Serverless v2 architecture (moved to versions/v1.0/)
- Complex WebSocket implementation
- Multi-service caching strategy
- Over-engineered MVP approach

### Dependencies
- UI/UX Agent must update designs for new constraints
- Data Model Agent should design for PostgreSQL, not Aurora
- DevOps Agent should implement simplified infrastructure

## [1.0] - 2025-01-12 (Morning)

### Added
- Initial architecture design with AWS serverless-first approach
- `aws-architecture.md` - Comprehensive AWS service selection
- `infrastructure-diagram.md` - Detailed infrastructure visualization
- `serverless-design.md` - Lambda function organization
- `tech-stack.md` - Technology decisions
- `domain-setup.md` - Domain configuration guide

### Key Decisions
- Aurora Serverless v2 for auto-scaling database
- ElastiCache + CloudFront for multi-layer caching
- Custom WebSocket API with Lambda
- EventBridge and SQS for event-driven architecture
- Estimated costs: $250-600/month

### Notes
- This version was reviewed and found to be over-engineered for MVP
- Preserved in versions/v1.0/ for future reference when scaling
