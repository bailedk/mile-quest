# Architecture Agent Changelog

All notable changes to the Architecture documentation will be documented in this file.

## [2.0] - 2025-01-12

### Changed
- **Major Simplification**: Reduced architecture complexity by 75% based on Review Agent recommendations
- Switched from Aurora Serverless v2 to RDS PostgreSQL Multi-AZ (60% cost reduction)
- Replaced custom WebSocket infrastructure with Pusher managed service (80% cost reduction)
- Removed ElastiCache from MVP, relying on CloudFront only (100% cost reduction)
- Deferred GraphQL implementation, using REST with field filtering
- Total infrastructure cost reduced from $250-600/month to $70-150/month

### Added
- Clear migration triggers for scaling decisions
- `mvp-architecture.md` - Simplified architecture documentation
- `infrastructure-diagram-mvp.md` - New simplified infrastructure diagram
- `architecture-decisions-v2.md` - Detailed evaluation of each recommendation
- `summary-v2.md` - Executive summary of changes

### Deprecated
- Original Aurora Serverless v2 architecture (moved to versions/v1.0/)
- Complex WebSocket implementation
- Multi-service caching strategy
- Over-engineered MVP approach

### Dependencies
- UI/UX Agent must update designs for new constraints
- Data Model Agent should design for PostgreSQL, not Aurora
- DevOps Agent should implement simplified infrastructure

## [1.0] - 2025-01-12 (Morning)

### Added
- Initial architecture design with AWS serverless-first approach
- `aws-architecture.md` - Comprehensive AWS service selection
- `infrastructure-diagram.md` - Detailed infrastructure visualization
- `serverless-design.md` - Lambda function organization
- `tech-stack.md` - Technology decisions
- `domain-setup.md` - Domain configuration guide

### Key Decisions
- Aurora Serverless v2 for auto-scaling database
- ElastiCache + CloudFront for multi-layer caching
- Custom WebSocket API with Lambda
- EventBridge and SQS for event-driven architecture
- Estimated costs: $250-600/month

### Notes
- This version was reviewed and found to be over-engineered for MVP
- Preserved in versions/v1.0/ for future reference when scaling
