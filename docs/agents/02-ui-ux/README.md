# Mile Quest UI/UX Design Documentation

## Overview

This documentation contains all UI/UX design decisions, patterns, and specifications for Mile Quest - a mobile-first team walking challenge platform. Our design approach prioritizes intuitive user experiences, accessibility, and engagement through thoughtful visual design and interaction patterns.

**Version 2.0 Update**: Documentation has been updated to align with the simplified MVP architecture, including adjustments for Pusher WebSockets, RDS PostgreSQL, optimistic UI updates, and progressive feature rollout.

## Design Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Mobile-First**: Every design decision starts with mobile constraints and scales up to larger screens
2. **Accessibility-Driven**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance is non-negotiable
3. **Performance-Conscious**: Design choices that minimize load times and optimize interactions
4. **Team-Centric**: Features that foster collaboration and healthy competition
5. **Progress-Oriented**: Clear visualization of achievements and goals

### Design Goals

- Reduce onboarding time to under 2 minutes
- Enable one-handed mobile operation for core features
- Provide instant visual feedback for all user actions
- Support offline-first interactions
- Create delightful moments through micro-interactions

## Documentation Structure

### Core Documents (v1)
1. **[User Journey Maps](user-journeys.md)** - Original comprehensive user flows
2. **[Wireframes](wireframes.md)** - Original full-feature wireframes
3. **[Design System](design-system.md)** - Complete component library
4. **[Data Visualization](data-visualization.md)** - Progress tracking designs
5. **[Gamification Elements](gamification.md)** - Full achievement system
6. **[Accessibility Guidelines](accessibility.md)** - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
7. **[Notification Patterns](notifications.md)** - Communication design

### MVP Updates (v2)
8. **[Design Review v2](design-review-v2.md)** - Response to simplified architecture
9. **[MVP Wireframes](mvp-wireframes.md)** - Simplified screens for faster launch
10. **[UI Architecture Alignment](ui-architecture-alignment.md)** - Technical integration guide

## Key Design Decisions

### Mobile-First Approach
- Primary viewport: 375x667px (iPhone SE)
- Touch targets: Minimum 44x44px
- Thumb-friendly navigation zones
- Gesture-based interactions

### Visual Language
- Clean, modern aesthetic with subtle depth
- High contrast for outdoor readability
- Consistent icon family (Feather Icons)
- Playful but professional tone

### Information Architecture
- Maximum 3-tap depth for any feature
- Progressive disclosure for complex flows
- Contextual help and onboarding
- Smart defaults to reduce configuration

## Dependencies

This UI/UX design work depends on:
- **Architecture Agent**: Technical constraints and capabilities
- **Data Model Agent**: Understanding data relationships for visualization
- **Map Integration Agent**: Coordination on map interaction patterns

## Tools and Resources

- **Design Tool**: Figma (collaborative design)
- **Prototyping**: Figma prototypes for key flows
- **Asset Management**: Organized component library
- **Version Control**: Design file versioning in Figma

## Success Metrics

- Task completion rate > 95%
- User satisfaction score > 4.5/5
- Accessibility audit score: 100%
- Time to first meaningful action < 30 seconds
- Daily active user engagement > 60%

## Next Steps

1. Review Architecture Agent's technical constraints
2. Begin user journey mapping for core flows
3. Create initial wireframes for mobile screens
4. Establish foundational design system elements
