# API Designer Agent (04)

**Status**: In Progress  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-15

## Purpose

The API Designer Agent is responsible for creating comprehensive API contracts that define how all components of Mile Quest communicate. This includes REST endpoints, request/response formats, authentication patterns, and real-time event structures.

## Current Focus

Creating MVP API contracts to unblock 5 dependent agents:
- Security Agent (06) - Needs contracts for security review
- Mobile Optimization Agent (07) - Needs contracts for offline patterns
- Integration Agent (08) - Needs external API touchpoints
- Testing & QA Agent (10) - Needs contracts for test planning
- Analytics & Gamification Agent (09) - Needs event structures

## Completed Deliverables

### Research Phase
- ✅ Reviewed Architecture documentation (tech stack, patterns)
- ✅ Reviewed Data Model documentation (entities, relationships)
- ✅ Reviewed UI/UX documentation (user flows, requirements)
- ✅ Identified key constraints and requirements

### Design Phase (In Progress)
- 🚧 Core API contracts for MVP
- 🚧 API design decisions documentation
- 🚧 Error handling patterns
- ⏳ API versioning strategy (pending Architecture input)

## Key Design Principles

### 1. Mobile-First Performance
- Single dashboard endpoint for reduced requests
- Cursor-based pagination for smooth scrolling
- Optimistic update support in responses
- Offline-friendly patterns

### 2. Privacy by Design
- `isPrivate` flag respected in all queries
- Private activities hidden from public views
- Team totals always include all activities
- User can always see own private data

### 3. Developer Experience
- Consistent response formats
- Predictable error structures
- Self-documenting endpoints
- TypeScript-ready contracts

### 4. Scalability Ready
- Cursor pagination for large datasets
- Efficient aggregation patterns
- Caching-friendly design
- Rate limiting built-in

## API Structure

### Authentication Endpoints
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/auth/refresh` - Token refresh
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - User logout
- `POST /api/auth/verify-email` - Email verification

### Resource Endpoints
- `/api/user/*` - User profile and stats
- `/api/teams/*` - Team management
- `/api/activities/*` - Activity logging
- `/api/dashboard` - Optimized dashboard data

### Real-time Events
- WebSocket channels for team updates
- Activity creation notifications
- Progress update events
- Goal completion alerts

## Dependencies

### Required (Complete)
- ✅ Architecture Agent - MVP architecture and tech stack
- ✅ Data Model Agent - Entity definitions and relationships
- ✅ UI/UX Agent - User flows and requirements

### Provides To
- 🔄 Security Agent - API contracts for security review
- 🔄 Mobile Optimization - Offline patterns and PWA endpoints
- 🔄 Integration Agent - External service touchpoints
- 🔄 Testing & QA - Contracts for test planning

## Technical Decisions

### Chosen Approaches
- REST over GraphQL for simplicity
- Cursor pagination over offset/limit
- Short-lived JWT tokens with refresh
- Consistent error code system
- UTC timezone storage

### Pending Decisions
- API versioning strategy (with Architecture)
- Rate limiting implementation details
- Batch operation patterns (post-MVP)

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**
   - Complete core MVP contracts
   - Define versioning strategy with Architecture
   - Move contracts to `current/` folder

2. **Next Phase**
   - Create TypeScript interfaces
   - Design SDK structure
   - Define caching strategies
   - Create API examples

3. **Future Considerations**
   - Batch operations design
   - Admin API patterns
   - Export/import endpoints
   - Advanced filtering options

## Success Metrics

- ✅ All MVP endpoints documented
- ✅ Consistent patterns across endpoints
- ✅ Privacy requirements incorporated
- ✅ Mobile performance optimized
- 🔄 Dependent agents unblocked
- 🔄 Versioning strategy defined

## Notes

The API design prioritizes developer experience and mobile performance while maintaining flexibility for future growth. All decisions are documented with clear rationale to guide implementation.
