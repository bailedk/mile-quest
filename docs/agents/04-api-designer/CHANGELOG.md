## Version 1.0 - 2025-01-15

### Status: In Progress

### Completed
- Reviewed Architecture Agent documentation (MVP architecture, tech stack, abstraction patterns)
- Reviewed Data Model Agent documentation (Prisma schema, entities, access patterns)
- Reviewed UI/UX Agent documentation (wireframes, user flows)
- Created agent structure (STATE.json, backlog.json, CHANGELOG.md)
- Identified key constraints and requirements for API design

### In Progress
- Creating core API contracts for authentication
- Creating core API contracts for team management
- Creating core API contracts for activity logging
- Defining API versioning strategy

### Key Findings
- Must use Next.js App Router API routes (/api/*)
- Authentication via Cognito (must be abstracted)
- Privacy controls via isPrivate flag on activities
- Offline-first design required for mobile
- Real-time updates via WebSocket (Pusher abstracted)
- Single dashboard API call optimization needed

### Next Steps
- Complete MVP API contracts
- Define versioning strategy with Architecture Agent
- Create API documentation and examples
- Provide contracts to dependent agents
