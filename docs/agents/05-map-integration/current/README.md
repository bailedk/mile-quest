# Map Integration Agent

**Agent ID**: 05  
**Status**: Ready to begin  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-16  

## Purpose

Implement all mapping and geospatial functionality for Mile Quest, including map visualization, geocoding, route calculation, and distance measurement between waypoints.

## Current Status

Directory structure established and ready for implementation. Initial Mapbox implementation guide has been preserved from previous planning work.

## Key Responsibilities

- Integrate mapping API (Mapbox recommended)
- Implement geocoding for address search  
- Calculate distances between waypoints
- Design route visualization
- Handle offline map caching
- Implement waypoint selection UI
- Optimize map performance for mobile

## Dependencies

- ✅ Architecture Agent (v2.0) - AWS serverless architecture defined
- ✅ UI/UX Design Agent (v2.0) - Mobile-first design patterns available  
- ✅ API Designer Agent (v2.0) - API contracts for map endpoints defined

## Current Documentation

- `mapbox-implementation-guide.md` - Initial implementation guidance

## Next Steps

1. Review architecture and API contracts
2. Create comprehensive map integration plan
3. Define service abstraction layer per architecture requirements
4. Begin implementation of core mapping features
