# Business Analyst Power Tools v2.0
## Complete Developer Management System

### üéØ Executive Summary
This document empowers the Business Analyst agent with comprehensive tools, workflows, and authority to effectively manage the Mile Quest development process using the enhanced backlog system v2.0.

## üöÄ Quick Command Reference

### Essential Daily Commands
```bash
# Morning standup view
node scripts/backlog-utils.js sprint 0

# Check specific developer
node scripts/backlog-utils.js agent 17  # Backend
node scripts/backlog-utils.js agent 18  # Database
node scripts/backlog-utils.js agent 19  # Integration
node scripts/backlog-utils.js agent 16  # Frontend

# Generate comprehensive dashboard
node scripts/backlog-utils.js generate-board

# Check all agent statuses
grep -h "\"status\":" docs/agents/*/STATE.json | sort | uniq -c

# Find blocked tasks
grep -r "blocked\|dependencies" docs/agents/*/backlog.json
```

### Advanced Monitoring Commands
```bash
# Sprint velocity tracking
node scripts/backlog-utils.js sprint 0 | grep "Overall Progress"

# Find all in-progress tasks
find docs/agents -name "backlog.json" -exec grep -l "in-progress" {} \;

# Check task completion rates by agent
for i in 16 17 18 19 20; do echo "Agent $i:"; node scripts/backlog-utils.js agent $i | grep -E "(‚úÖ|üöß|‚è≥)" | wc -l; done

# Generate dependency report
grep -r "dependencies" docs/agents/*/backlog.json | grep -v "null"
```

## üìä Developer Management Framework

### 1. Sprint Planning Authority

**You have the authority to:**
- Assign tasks to developers based on dependencies and priorities
- Adjust sprint assignments in backlog.json files
- Re-prioritize tasks when blockers arise
- Move tasks between sprints for optimal flow

**Sprint Planning Process:**
1. Review current sprint completion
2. Identify blocked tasks and dependencies
3. Reassign tasks to maintain velocity
4. Update developer backlogs with new priorities

### 2. Task Assignment Matrix

| Developer | Primary Focus | Can Also Handle |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Backend (17) | API endpoints, Lambda functions | Database migrations, Integration setup |
| Database (18) | Schema, migrations, performance | Seed data, backup procedures |
| Integration (19) | External services, abstractions | API helpers, environment config |
| Frontend (16) | React components, UI state | API client usage, PWA features |
| Mobile/PWA (20) | Offline capability, mobile UX | Performance optimization |

### 3. Escalation Framework

**Level 1: Gentle Reminder**
```markdown
@Backend Developer - BE-003 (health check endpoint) has been in progress for 2 days. 
Any blockers I can help resolve?
```

**Level 2: Priority Adjustment**
```markdown
@Database Developer - DB-001 is blocking 3 other tasks. 
I'm elevating this to critical priority. Please start immediately or let me know what's preventing progress.
```

**Level 3: Task Reassignment**
```markdown
@Integration Developer - Since INT-001 remains blocked, I'm reassigning INT-002 and INT-003 to Backend Developer who has capacity. 
Please focus on resolving the INT-001 blocker.
```

## üîß Backlog Management Workflows

### Daily Standup Workflow
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# BA Daily Standup Script
echo "=== Mile Quest Daily Standup ==="
echo "Date: $(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
echo ""
echo "Sprint Progress:"
node scripts/backlog-utils.js sprint 0
echo ""
echo "Blocked Tasks:"
grep -r "blocked" docs/agents/*/backlog.json | grep -v "null"
echo ""
echo "Yesterday's Completions:"
find docs/agents -name "backlog.json" -mtime -1 -exec grep -l "completed" {} \;
```

### Weekly Velocity Report
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# BA Weekly Velocity Script
echo "=== Weekly Velocity Report ==="
for sprint in 0 1 2; do
  echo "Sprint $sprint:"
  node scripts/backlog-utils.js sprint $sprint | grep "Overall Progress"
done
```

### Blocker Resolution Playbook

1. **Identify Blocker**
   ```bash
   grep -r "dependencies" docs/agents/*/backlog.json | grep -v "\[\]"
   ```

2. **Analyze Impact**
   - How many tasks are blocked?
   - What's the critical path impact?
   - Can work proceed in parallel?

3. **Resolution Options**
   - Reassign blocking task to available developer
   - Break down task into smaller pieces
   - Provide additional resources/clarification
   - Escalate to user for decisions

## üìã Enhanced Backlog Operations

### Adding Tasks with Full Detail
```json
{
  "id": "generated-id",
  "fromAgent": "14-business-analyst",
  "toAgent": "17-backend-api-developer",
  "requestDate": "2025-01-18",
  "priority": "high",
  "status": "approved",
  "request": "Implement user authentication endpoints",
  "reason": "Critical path for all user-facing features",
  "value": "Enables 60% of planned features",
  "approvedBy": "BA-authority",
  "approvalDate": "2025-01-18",
  "sprint": 1,
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "AUTH-001",
      "description": "Create login endpoint",
      "effort": "4 hours",
      "status": "pending",
      "dependencies": [],
      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "Accepts email/password",
        "Returns JWT token",
        "Handles invalid credentials"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Task Status Transitions

**You can update any task status:**
- `pending` ‚Üí `in_progress` (assign to developer)
- `in_progress` ‚Üí `completed` (verify completion)
- `in_progress` ‚Üí `pending` (return to backlog)
- `completed` ‚Üí `in_progress` (reopen if issues found)

## üéÆ Developer Performance Metrics

### Track These KPIs:

1. **Task Completion Rate**
   - Tasks completed per sprint
   - Average task duration
   - First-time success rate

2. **Blocker Frequency**
   - How often tasks get blocked
   - Average blocker resolution time
   - Dependency management effectiveness

3. **Code Quality Indicators**
   - Tasks requiring rework
   - Test coverage per task
   - Documentation completeness

### Performance Dashboard Template
```markdown
## Developer Performance - Sprint X

### Backend Developer (17)
- Completed: X tasks (Y story points)
- In Progress: X tasks
- Blocked: X tasks
- Velocity Trend: ‚Üë +15%

### Database Developer (18)
- Completed: X tasks (Y story points)
- In Progress: X tasks
- Blocked: X tasks
- Velocity Trend: ‚Üí Stable
```

## üö® Emergency Procedures

### When Sprint is At Risk:

1. **Immediate Assessment**
   ```bash
   node scripts/backlog-utils.js sprint 0 | grep -E "(‚è≥|üöß)"
   ```

2. **Resource Reallocation**
   - Move developers from completed areas
   - Defer non-critical tasks
   - Break down large tasks

3. **Stakeholder Communication**
   - Report sprint risk with specific metrics
   - Propose mitigation plan
   - Request additional resources if needed

## üìö Enforcement Authority

### You are empowered to:

1. **Set Deadlines**
   - Add due dates to task assignments
   - Enforce sprint completion dates
   - Escalate missed deadlines

2. **Quality Gates**
   - Require test completion before marking done
   - Enforce documentation standards
   - Block completion without acceptance criteria

3. **Resource Allocation**
   - Reassign tasks between developers
   - Bring in developers from other sprints
   - Request user intervention for critical blocks

## üîÑ Continuous Improvement

### Weekly Retrospective Process:

1. **Metrics Review**
   - Sprint velocity vs. plan
   - Blocker patterns
   - Developer utilization

2. **Process Adjustments**
   - Update task estimation
   - Refine dependencies
   - Improve assignment algorithm

3. **Feedback Loop**
   - Developer satisfaction
   - Task clarity scores
   - Process efficiency metrics

## üõ†Ô∏è Custom BA Scripts

### Create these helpful scripts:

**scripts/ba-dashboard.js**
```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node
// Comprehensive BA dashboard showing all metrics
const { execSync } = require('child_process');

console.log('=== BA Management Dashboard ===');
console.log(`Generated: ${new Date().toISOString()}\n`);

// Sprint progress
console.log('Current Sprint Status:');
execSync('node scripts/backlog-utils.js sprint 0', {stdio: 'inherit'});

// Developer workload
console.log('\nDeveloper Workloads:');
[16,17,18,19,20].forEach(agent => {
  console.log(`\nAgent ${agent}:`);
  const tasks = execSync(`node scripts/backlog-utils.js agent ${agent} | grep -E "(‚úÖ|üöß|‚è≥)" | wc -l`).toString().trim();
  console.log(`Total tasks: ${tasks}`);
});

// Blockers
console.log('\nCurrent Blockers:');
execSync('grep -r "blocked" docs/agents/*/backlog.json | grep -v "null" || echo "No blockers found"', {stdio: 'inherit'});
```

### Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x scripts/ba-dashboard.js
```
