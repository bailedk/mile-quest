## Weekly Focus Areas

### Week of 2025-01-15
1. **Fix Compliance Issues** - Review & Enhancement Agent structure
2. **Start API Design** - Unblock 4 dependent agents
3. **Update Documentation** - All agents ensure backlogs are current

### Week of 2025-01-22
1. **API Implementation** - Based on contracts from API Designer
2. **DevOps Setup** - Development environment and CI/CD
3. **Security Planning** - Authentication strategy based on API design

## Risk Register

### High Risk
- **Review Agent Non-Compliance**: 25% score needs immediate fix
- **API Designer Bottleneck**: 4 agents blocked waiting for contracts

### Medium Risk
- **Cross-Agent Communication**: Need better coordination mechanism
- **Documentation Drift**: Living agents need regular doc updates

### Low Risk
- **Cost Overrun**: Architecture monitoring $70/month budget

## Recommendations (Updated Post-Analysis)

### Recommended Agent Activation Order:
1. **API Designer (04)** - START IMMEDIATELY - Unblocks 5 agents
2. **Review & Enhancement (12)** - URGENT - Fix 25% compliance
3. **Data Model (03)** - Quick 5-minute fix for AGENTS.md
4. **DevOps (11)** - Can work in parallel, no blockers
5. **Architecture (01)** - API versioning strategy (arch-002)

### Key Insights:
- **API Designer is the critical bottleneck** - 5 agents waiting
- **Review Agent needs emergency compliance fixes** - 4 high-priority items
- **25% of work is blocked** by missing API contracts
- **Parallel work possible**: DevOps can start infrastructure while API design happens

### Process Improvements:
1. **Daily**: BA monitors all backlogs for new blockers
2. **48-Hour**: Review activation recommendations
3. **Weekly**: Full dashboard and dependency analysis
4. **Monthly**: Compliance audit by Agent 13

## Notes

- All tasks currently in "pending" status await user approval
- Backlog items should be reviewed and approved in priority order
- Cross-agent dependencies should be communicated proactively
- Weekly updates to this dashboard ensure accurate tracking
