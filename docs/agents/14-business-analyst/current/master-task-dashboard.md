## Weekly Focus Areas

### Week of 2025-01-15
1. **Fix Compliance Issues** - Review & Enhancement Agent structure
2. **Start API Design** - Unblock 4 dependent agents
3. **Update Documentation** - All agents ensure backlogs are current

### Week of 2025-01-22
1. **API Implementation** - Based on contracts from API Designer
2. **DevOps Setup** - Development environment and CI/CD
3. **Security Planning** - Authentication strategy based on API design

## Risk Register

### High Risk
- **Review Agent Non-Compliance**: 25% score needs immediate fix
- **API Designer Bottleneck**: 4 agents blocked waiting for contracts

### Medium Risk
- **Cross-Agent Communication**: Need better coordination mechanism
- **Documentation Drift**: Living agents need regular doc updates

### Low Risk
- **Cost Overrun**: Architecture monitoring $70/month budget

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate**: Assign Review & Enhancement fixes as top priority
2. **This Week**: Start API Designer work to unblock dependencies
3. **Process**: Implement daily standup for agents with active tasks
4. **Long-term**: Consider automated backlog monitoring tools

## Notes

- All tasks currently in "pending" status await user approval
- Backlog items should be reviewed and approved in priority order
- Cross-agent dependencies should be communicated proactively
- Weekly updates to this dashboard ensure accurate tracking
