## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Organization
- Follow Next.js 14 app directory structure
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Implement service abstractions for all external dependencies
- Maintain clear separation between UI and business logic

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Component tests for UI elements
- E2E tests for critical user flows

### Performance Considerations
- Implement lazy loading for components
- Use React Server Components where appropriate
- Optimize images and assets
- Implement proper caching strategies

### Security Requirements
- All API endpoints must be authenticated
- Implement proper input validation
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Follow OWASP guidelines

## Milestone Definitions

### MVP Milestone (End of Phase 3)
- Users can create/join teams
- Submit walking activities
- View progress on map
- Basic team collaboration

### Beta Milestone (End of Phase 5)
- Full gamification features
- Real-time updates
- Polished UI/UX
- Performance optimized

### Production Milestone (End of Phase 7)
- All integrations functional
- Comprehensive testing complete
- Monitoring in place
- Documentation complete

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **External service dependencies**: Mitigated by abstraction layer
- **Performance at scale**: Address with caching and optimization
- **Mobile compatibility**: Test early and often
- **Data privacy**: Implement privacy controls from start

### Timeline Risks
- **Feature creep**: Stick to defined phases
- **Integration delays**: Start OAuth approvals early
- **Testing bottlenecks**: Automate testing early
- **Deployment issues**: Practice deployments regularly

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve implementation plan
2. Set up development environment
3. Begin Phase 1 implementation
4. Establish weekly progress reviews
5. Create detailed sprint plans
