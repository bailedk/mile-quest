# Backlog Integration Strategy

## Combining Agent Backlogs with Development Tasks

### Current System Enhancement

The existing agent backlog system is excellent for:
- Cross-agent communication
- High-level feature requests
- Approval workflows
- Living agent model

We enhance it by adding:
- Granular task breakdown within backlog items
- Sprint grouping for time management
- Progress tracking at task level
- Dependency visualization

### Integrated Backlog Structure

```json
{
  "backlog": [
    {
      "id": "unique-id",
      "fromAgent": "requesting-agent",
      "toAgent": "implementing-agent",
      "requestDate": "date",
      "priority": "high|medium|low",
      "status": "pending|approved|in-progress|completed",
      "request": "High-level request description",
      "reason": "Why this is needed",
      "value": "Business value provided",
      "sprint": 0,  // NEW: Sprint assignment
      "tasks": [    // NEW: Granular task breakdown
        {
          "id": "TASK-ID",
          "description": "Specific task",
          "effort": "hours",
          "status": "pending|in-progress|completed",
          "dependencies": ["OTHER-TASK-ID"],
          "acceptanceCriteria": ["criteria1", "criteria2"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Benefits of Integration

1. **Preserves existing system** - No breaking changes
2. **Adds granularity** - Tasks within backlog items
3. **Maintains flexibility** - Agents can still add items anytime
4. **Enables tracking** - Progress at both levels
5. **Supports planning** - Sprint assignment optional

### How Agents Work

1. **Development Planning Agent** creates bundled backlog items with tasks
2. **Developer Agents** receive high-level backlog items containing specific tasks
3. **Progress tracked** at both backlog item and task level
4. **Dependencies** managed within task structure
5. **Original workflow** preserved for non-development requests

### Example Workflow

```bash
# BA Agent adds to Frontend Developer backlog
"Implement user authentication UI" 
  → Contains tasks: FE-101 through FE-107
  → Approved by user
  → Frontend dev works through tasks
  → Updates task status
  → Marks backlog item complete when all tasks done
```

### Advantages Over Separate Systems

1. **Single source of truth** - All work in backlog.json
2. **Consistent approval** - User approves bundles
3. **Flexible granularity** - Some items have tasks, some don't
4. **Agent autonomy** - Agents manage their own backlogs
5. **Backwards compatible** - Existing items still work

### Task Board Integration

The TASK-BOARD.md becomes a view that:
- Aggregates tasks from all agent backlogs
- Shows sprint progress across agents
- Identifies blockers and dependencies
- Provides executive dashboard

### Tracking Commands Update

```bash
# Check agent's backlog including tasks
node scripts/agent-backlog.js status 16-frontend-developer

# Show all Sprint 0 tasks across agents
node scripts/agent-backlog.js sprint 0

# Update task within backlog item
node scripts/agent-backlog.js update fe-sprint0-bundle FE-001 complete
```

This approach leverages your excellent backlog system while adding the granular tracking needed for development work!
